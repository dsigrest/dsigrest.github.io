            <h1>PNW Cookie Cutters</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            As an introduction to Rhino, our class made cookie cutters from shapes we found in images! The goal was to process an image through photoshop and illustrator, import the prepared file into Rhino, then build our cookie cutters from the resulting curves and export them as <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jBgeQpc9aVP6xg4_KclfrooEO0cNWRkb"> .STL's</a>. Check out the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1prsVizpT9sgzJ4a3Y-s5slncXVPnF8BJ"> Rhino files </a> here! Want to see how I did it? Read on!

<h2>Step One: Preparing the Images</h2>
<p>
   To make clear cookie cutters, I wanted to choose photos that had distinct silhouettes and graphic shapes. I decided to go with a PNW theme, and chose photos on the [link] space needle, [link] ferns, and [link]sasquatch. Talk about how you picked your images (graphic with distinct outlines), adjusting the threshold in photoshop, using imagetrace and creating outlines in illustrator, as well as cleaning up the extra shapes in illustrator (used the pathfinder tool). I cleaned up the image, In some, I embellished the image to make it morelegible. Then, I exported it as a .dwg- paying careful attention to the scale and units I was exporting it at.

<h2>Step Two: Import the File to Rhino </h2>
<p>
    Talk about opening new file in the correct units (inches)- saves time later (learned this the hard way). Check the size, center it. Use the rebuild function to simplify any excess points.

<h2>Step Three: Extrude Your Shapes</h2>
    <p>
    We create the base for the cookie cutter's walls using the offset tool. I made mine 0.125" thick. Then, I extruded the walls to approximately 2". I created the base by once again offsetting the original cure- this time by 0.5", and extruding a solid surface up about 0.5". Similarly, I created the cookie cutter's inner details by offsetting curves and extruding surfaces.

<h2>Step Four: Finishing Up and Exporting</h2>
<p>
    talk about using the boolean union to connect all your shapes, then exporting as an STL.
