    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                To learn about printing nested geometry and get a better handle on grasshopper, I created these nested heart trays. You can reference my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uvFtX47YglKROAeTPaI25zFSxOaU_b_K"> Rhino File</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FycJjxYEshiGeE438OJvSH8inJUQLPei/view?usp=sharing"> Grasshopper definition </a> here, and see my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J00FRohqCxBTO271k8itUdaLN-ld3giQ"> .STL here</a>! Want to see how I made it? Read on!
                </p>

<h1>Part One: STL Mesh</h1>

<p>
    I built my heart in illustrator, then imported it into Rhino. There, I was able to begin working in Grasshopper.
        </p>

<h2>Imported STLs</h2>
<p>
    I created a polygon component in Grasshopper, then connected my imported geometry to it. I used a linear array to make copies of my shape, then offset their curves at increasing intervals of specified distances to create the nested walls of my trays. I referenced Josh's tutorials to help me properly pair the walls and extrude them as solid objects. Then, I baked my definition and moved the separate trays along the Z axis in Rhino. Crating this spacing allowed me to use the slicer to generate supports, which would allow me to print 3 separate geometries on top of one another.

<h2>Mesh Manipulation</h2>
    <p>
        I generated supports under each of the nested hearts, so they could be deconstructed after printing.

<h2>Plan B</h2>

        I generated supports under each of the nested hearts, so they could be deconstructed after printing.

<h2>Modifying Mesh: Round Two</h2>
