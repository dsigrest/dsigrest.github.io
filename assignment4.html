            <h1>Meshes and Lamp (pt. 1)</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This week, I worked on creating one printable mesh from two separate STLs and getting started on my lamp project. I'll cover both projects over two parts in the documentation below! 
        </p>
<h1>Part One: STL Mesh</h1>

<p>
    Originally for this mesh assignment, I wanted to combine two STLs of classical sculptures to create a silly phone stand. I learned some important lessons along the way on checking if a mesh is a "good mesh" before you start working, and *why* it's challenging to work with very detailed meshes. After too much fiddling with my original plan, I pivoted and was able to successfully combine two simpler meshes.
        </p>
<h2>Imported STLs</h2>
<p>
   First, I imported these awesome sculpture STLs into rhino. The original files had ~millions of triangles, so I reduced them to about 150,000 each (which turned out to be unweildy, still!) I didn't check to see if these meshes were "good meshes" when I imported them- I wish now that I had. After resizing and manipulating their mesh, it would have been good to know if the issues came from me or the original files.
        </p>

<h2>Mesh Manipulation</h2>
     <p>
            I took measurements of my phone and used them to size and space the two statues. I also built a phone stand that could accomodate my phone in it's case- while plugged into the charger. Then, I used the "points on" command to manipulate their mesh so it didn't interfere with the arms that held the phone OR extend beyond the base I built for the stand. (I am sure this manipulation contributed to my "bad mesh" later down the road.)
        </p>  
<p>
    I converted my polysurface phone stand into a mesh, then tried several different methods (like BooleanMeshUnion, Join, etc) to merge the three pieces into a printable surface. I tried to repair the mesh afterwards, but to no avail. I think it was such a mess at that point, I'd need to try again with freshly imported meshes- then proceed with more caution while manipulating the mesh.

            </p>

<h2>Plan B</h2>
    <p>
        I decided to try again with simpler meshes to see if I could get it to work. On thingiverse, I found two pieces of simpler geometry that I wanted to combine in order to create a personalized plant clip (photos below). I checked to be sure that both of the meshes I imported were "good meshes" before starting to work. (Several files I found on thingiverse were not!)

            </p>

<h2>Modifying Mesh: Round Two</h2>
    <p>
        First, I removed parts of the flower FOB that I didn't want. I placed the flower where I wanted it to attach to the plant clip, and used BooleanMeshUnion to combine the shapes. After, I used RepairMesh to check that it was a good mesh. Finally, I exported the mesh as an STL- it passed all the rapid prototyping checks!

<h1>Part Two: Lamp</h1>
    <p>
        For the lamp project, I was inspired by John Grade's "Middle Fork" piece- now on display at the SAM. I'm drawn to the intersection of geometric and organic shapes, and wanted to incorporate that into my lamp. I also thought it'd be an excellent opportunity to work modularly with my printer(to avoid long prints and sizing limits from the printer).

        I generated supports under each of the nested hearts, so they could be deconstructed after printing.
