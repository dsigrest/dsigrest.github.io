    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This week I continued work on my lamp and began designing a mold. I had a blast working on the lamp! You can read more about how I built it below and find files related to the lamp <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlWajXTFC1MzhczpSdu5igU4pLt4LDZJ?usp=sharing"> here </a>.

<h1>Lamp: Grasshopper Tests</h1>

<p>
    While digging into how to create repeated geometric forms I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDFofhlWNxs"> super helpful tutorial</a> for making voronoi patterns in grasshopper. As a preliminary test, I made a small spiral surface with the voronoi pattern. There were some issues baking at first: it wasn’t making the holes from the voronoi cells or extruding the geometry correctly. I realized that I was scaling the voronoi cells too large- causing them to mesh into each other to create impossible shapes. After I adjusted for this, the voronoi surface baked perfectly.

            </p>
<p>
    I learned a good lesson after my test printed: the surface was fragile! I broke it taking it off the printer. Like a lot. I knew my next prints would need thicker walls.

<h2>Lamp Test Prints</h2>
<p>
   Now that I had my texture, I could apply it to whatever surface I wanted. At Nadya’s suggestion, I scoped back the shape I was originally planning on and applied my voronoi surface to elegant “chime” shapes. I plan to use this project as a stepping stone for continued work in my final project (applying the voronoi pattern to more complicated geometry- with greater precision.) I printed the tests at 50% height for the sake of time. This ended up working out later because the shorter print paired nicely with the tall print. My first test print had some issues: it’s base was too thin, and the pattern’s cells were too large for my liking. The base was so flimsy- it broke off the voronoi cells, and also in half as I tried to remove it from the printer.

            </p>
<p>
    The second version I printed had with a thicker base with denser infill. The supports were beautiful on this print. For fun, I tried it on the lamp guts before taking out all the cells. This gave me the idea to try a nesting shade to go over the voronoi lamp

<h2>Printing and Iterating</h2>
     <p>
            Some of the tests I wanted to print didn’t work out. I wanted to try prints with even thicker bases, as well as experiment with voronoi cells at various sizes and extruded depths. I loved working with the light and wanted to see how different textures would affect the effect it produced. HOWEVER: I ran into serious issues getting these polysurfaces to connect with the base of the lamp. My boolean unions kept failing. Upon some inspection and a few helpful tips from Josh, I learned that something in my Grasshopper definition was creating non-manifold polysurfaces when I extruded the voronoi pattern too thick. I’m still looking into this. In the meantime, this is what I landed on:
</p>
<p>
            <img src="L2_5.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
            <img src="L2_6.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
    I liked the warm cast the wood infill PLA gave the light, so I designed a nesting shade to pair with the voronoi cell surface. At first I wasn’t happy with the effect- the light was too weak (you can see this in the first picture). I played a bit with what strength and size lightbulb I paired with the lamp- I found one I liked for the big lamp (second photo), but didn’t have another to pair with the little guy. Maybe I’ll order one. Here’s how they turned out:
</p>
<p>
            <img src="L2_7a.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
            <img src="L2_7b.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
            <img src="L2_8.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
    I think ideally, I’d cover the ugly bits of the bulb with scant open voronois cells at the top of the lamp, moving to denser voronoi cells at the bottom (like a gradient). This would give me the best of both worlds: texture play and glowing warm color.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Next, I’m going to dig more into non-manifold edge issue in my GH definition and learn more about applying different geometry to surfaces. (I want a different shape for my final project.) I’d also like to learn how to applying patterns to surfaces in a gradient.

<h1>Mold: Part One</h1>
    <p>
        I’m really into gardening- so I decided to make a mold for cute planters. After some sketching, I landed on an asymmetrical cube (or any polygon!) design. I planned to make it in grasshopper so I could easily modify the number of surfaces and their skew.

            </p>
<p>
            <img src="M1_b.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
            <img src="M1_c.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
            <img src="M1_d.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
    I also sketched some of the molds and the mold-for-molds to try and wrap my head around what exactly I needed to make and how it would work.
</p>

            <img src="M2_a.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p>
    After MANY sketches, I decided the best move would be to build my final object and work with the molds and molds-for-molds directly in Rhino.
</p>

<h2>Initial Rhino Work</h2>
    <p>
        I made a grasshopper definition that produces a symmetrical cube planter and tried several methods to modify its shape. I didn’t think it would be this tough- I feel like I’m missing some obvious solution right in front of my face. I tried:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a cube in rhino and turning points on (they didn’t show up as I expected in the corners?!)
</li>
  <li>Baking the symmetrical cube from grasshopper and manipulating the points by hand (this time, the points were where I expected them. However, this made messy shapes. This method also wouldn’t allow me to easily customize my shapes later.)
</li>
  <li>Using “transform” in grasshopper
</li>
    <li>
        Using “twisted cube” in grasshopper (I was able to make a shape that I liked, but could not figure out how to extrude it to make a polysurface.)
    </li>
    <li>
     Some other things that I did not write down
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
You can see the twisted cube I made in the screen shots below, along with the symmetrical planter from grasshopper

<h2>Next Steps</h2> 
<p>
       I’m going to finish designing my “final object” and start building it’s mold… and that mold’s mold (what?) This project is making my eyes go crossed.
