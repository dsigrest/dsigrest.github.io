            <h1>Cardboard Clips Construction Kit</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For this assignment, I created a grasshopper definition that described a clip to connect two pieces of cardboard. I made a couple of quick test models before landing on a final design- which i build entirely with grasshopper. I landed on a hexagonal clip that can connect cardboard in 6 directions at 60 degree intervals. Here's a photo of my final construction! You can find my <LINK> STL here, <LINK> grasshopper definition here, and <LINK> rhino file here (this includes all my drafts, too!). You can even see a video of me <LINK> shaking the final construction. Read on to see how I built it!

<h2>Design Iterations</h2>
<p>
    I tested tolerances with initial models, using Illustrator to quickly build and extrude geometries based on the cardboard's dimensions. I used these to test how large to make the slots for the cardboard. Was it too loose? Too tight? Too shallow? I found that I needed broader arms for the clip in order to properly grasp the cardboard. A narrow conenction point allowed for some flexibility when inserting the cardboard.

<h2>Building in Grasshopper</h2>
<p>
    I applied my learnings from the inital modesl to appropriately size and design my final model: a multidirectional clip. The definition I built in grasshopper allows me to change the extrusion height, clip radius, number of sides and slots on the clip, and the depth and width of the slots. I tried to make the number of slows grow proportionally with the number of sides, but the slots became offset from the center as the number of sides grew. I'm not sure how to adjust for that.

<h2>Printing and Construction</h2>
    <p>
        I completed 2-3 test prints of my final design, adjusting with my grasshopper definition to create the right tolerance for my cardboard. When I was happy with the fit, I used the slicer to multiply my geometry and print it 9 additional times for a total of 10 clips.

    Then, I cut equilateral triangles to create my construction with the clips I designed and printed. Tada!
